The HBnB project in Holberton is a simplified full-stack clone of Airbnb, designed to cover backend development, database management, front-end integration, and deployment.

### 📘 [Part 1: UML Diagrams](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1)
We launched the development of the HBnB Evolution application by creating a detailed blueprint. This technical document compiles all essential diagrams and explanations, serving as a comprehensive guide to the system’s architecture, design, and implementation phases detailing the steps from the user to the database.


1. [The high-level architecture of the application](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/00-architecture_diagram.md) with a package diagram that outlines the three layers and the use of the Facade Pattern.

2. [Detailed diagrams representing the business logic layer](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/01-class_diagram.md) with a detailed class diagram illustrating key entities and their relationships.

3. [Sequence diagrams for key API interactions](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-sequence_diagram.md) depicting critical operations such as :
    - **[user registration](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-user_registration.md)** 
    - **[place creation](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-place_creation.md)**
    - **[review submission](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-review_submission.md)**
